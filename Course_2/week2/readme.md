# Week 2

## Option 1 (General)

Write enumerated types that supports dates—such as december 12. Then add a function that produces a next day.  So nextday(date) of december 12 is december 13. Also write a function printdate(date) that prints a date legibly.The function can assume that February has 28 days and it most know how many days are in each month. Use a struct with two members; one is the month and the second  is the day of the month—an int (or short).

## Week 2 Honors Assignment

Use a struct to define a card as an enumerated member that is its suit value and a short that is its pips value.

Write a function that randomly shuffles the deck.

Submit your work as a text file.

Then deal out 7 card hands and evaluate the probability that a hand has no pair, one pair, two pair, three of a kind, full house and 4 of a kind.  This is a Monte Carlo method to get an approximation to these probabilities.  Use at least 1 million randomly generated hands.

You can check against probabilities found in a standard table.
