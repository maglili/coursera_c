# Option 1 (General)

Write enumerated types that supports dates—such as december 12. Then add a function that produces a next day.  So nextday(date) of december 12 is december 13. Also write a function printdate(date) that prints a date legibly.The function can assume that February has 28 days and it most know how many days are in each month. Use a struct with two members; one is the month and the second  is the day of the month—an int (or short).
